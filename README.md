# Pajama
A programming language that transpiles to both JS Canvas games and PyGame games 

This was created in a weekend back in 2013. I found a zip file of a backup of it
while going through an old server and decided it ought to be under modern source
control for posterity, I guess. It used to under Google Code, but never made its
way to GitHub.

This is not being actively developed! Use at your own risk.
